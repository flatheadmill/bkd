# Development Diary

## Entry 1: Initial Architecture Analysis and Lucene/Tantivy Research
**Date**: July 25, 2025
**Session**: Deep dive into Lucene BKD implementation and Tantivy integration planning

### üîç Research Findings

#### Lucene BKD Implementation Deep Dive

**Key Source Files Analyzed**:
- `lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/bkd/BKDConfig.java`
- `lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/document/ShapeField.java`
- `lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/bkd/BKDWriter.java`
- `lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/geo/Tessellator.java`

**Critical Discovery - Shape Configuration**:
```java
// Line 48 in BKDConfig.java - "cover lucene shapes"
new BKDConfig(7, 4, 4, DEFAULT_MAX_POINTS_IN_LEAF_NODE)
```
This confirms our 7-dimensional approach is exactly what Lucene uses for spatial shapes!

**Triangle Encoding Validation**:
- Our implementation in `triangle.rs` matches Lucene's `ShapeField.encodeTriangle()` exactly
- Canonical form algorithm identical: minX rotation + CCW orientation
- Edge flags stored in bits 3-5 of metadata dimension
- Bounding box dimensions: `[minY, minX, maxY, maxX]` for spatial indexing

**BKD Tree Architecture**:
- Default 512 points per leaf (`DEFAULT_MAX_POINTS_IN_LEAF_NODE`)
- Up to 8 index dimensions, 16 total dimensions max
- Heap threshold: 16MB before spilling to disk
- Page-oriented storage for large datasets

#### Tantivy Architecture Analysis

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Well-developed range query infrastructure
- ‚úÖ FastField system for numeric data
- ‚úÖ Extensible Query trait
- ‚ùå **No existing spatial support** - clean slate for implementation

**Integration Opportunities**:
- Range query patterns directly applicable to bounding box queries
- FastField infrastructure could accelerate spatial indexing
- Schema system extensible for new spatial field types
- Query processing pipeline ready for spatial query integration

### üéØ Architectural Decisions Made

#### Decision 1: Library-First Approach
**Rationale**: Build BKD as standalone library, then create Tantivy integration layer
**Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable in other Rust projects
- Easier testing and validation
- Follows Tantivy's own design philosophy

#### Decision 2: Maintain Lucene Compatibility
**Rationale**: Proven algorithm with extensive real-world validation
**Implementation**:
- Keep identical triangle encoding (already done)
- Match BKD configuration parameters
- Preserve disk format compatibility where possible

#### Decision 3: Arena-Based Memory Management
**Rationale**: Better cache locality and reduced fragmentation vs Box allocation
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Improved performance for bulk operations
- ‚úÖ Serialization-friendly NodeId system
- ‚ùå More complex lifetime management
- ‚ùå Learning curve for contributors

### üöß Technical Concerns & Challenges

#### Concern 1: Tessellation Integration
**Challenge**: Lucene has 1,703 lines of custom tessellation code
**Options**:
1. Port Lucene's tessellator (high effort, guaranteed compatibility)
2. Use existing Rust crates like `lyon_tessellation` (faster, potential compatibility issues)
3. Hybrid approach - use Rust crate with Lucene validation

**Current Thinking**: Start with lyon_tessellation, validate against Lucene test cases

#### Concern 2: Disk Storage Format
**Challenge**: Tantivy uses different storage primitives than Lucene
**Considerations**:
- Lucene uses IndexOutput/IndexInput
- Tantivy uses different directory/file abstractions
- Need to maintain spatial query performance

**Current Thinking**: Abstract over storage layer, focus on algorithm correctness first

#### Concern 3: Query Performance Parity
**Challenge**: Must match or exceed Lucene's spatial query performance
**Benchmarking Plan**:
- Implement Lucene-equivalent test dataset
- Measure triangle encoding/decoding speed
- Benchmark tree construction time
- Compare spatial query performance

### üîÑ Implementation Phases Refined

Based on source code analysis, refined our implementation phases:

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ‚úÖ Triangle encoding (100% Lucene compatible)
- ‚ö™ Generic KD-Tree extension
- ‚ö™ BKD configuration system
- ‚ö™ Basic tree construction

#### Phase 2: Core BKD Algorithm
- ‚ö™ BKDWriter port from Lucene
- ‚ö™ Block-based leaf structure
- ‚ö™ Recursive splitting algorithm
- ‚ö™ Disk spilling mechanism

#### Phase 3: Tantivy Integration
- ‚ö™ Spatial field types (`LatLonShape`, `XYShape`)
- ‚ö™ BKD index writer integration
- ‚ö™ Spatial query implementation
- ‚ö™ FastField optimization

### üí≠ Open Questions for Next Sessions

1. **Generic vs Const Generic Dimensions**: Should we use `const N: usize` or runtime configuration?
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: How to handle geometric edge cases (degenerate triangles, etc.)?
3. **Serialization Format**: Binary compatible with Lucene or Tantivy-native?
4. **Threading Model**: How to integrate with Tantivy's concurrent indexing?

### üìö Learning & References

**Key Lucene Concepts Understood**:
- BKD trees are specialized for spatial data with separate index/data dimensions
- Triangle encoding enables efficient polygon queries via tessellation
- Block-based leaves optimize for both memory usage and query performance

**Rust Ecosystem Insights**:
- Tantivy's architecture is very amenable to spatial extensions
- Arena allocation pattern works well for tree structures
- Type system can encode dimensional constraints at compile time

### üéØ Next Session Goals

1. Implement generic KD-Tree supporting configurable dimensions
2. Study BKDWriter splitting algorithm in detail
3. Create basic BKD configuration system matching Lucene
4. Begin tessellation integration research

## Entry 2: Documentation Structure and Development Workflow
**Date**: July 25, 2025
**Session**: Establishing diary-based documentation approach and workflow

### üìù Documentation Architecture Decision

**Problem**: Need to maintain detailed technical context while keeping README accessible and concise.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **README.md**: Concise, current status, essential information
- **diary.md**: Chronological technical discussions, decisions, and research findings
- **Code comments**: Detailed algorithm explanations and Lucene references

### üîÑ Diary Workflow Established

**Key Principle**: **Additive only** - new entries capture real-time thinking, no retroactive editing
**Benefits**:
- Preserves authentic decision-making process
- Shows evolution of understanding over time
- Maintains historical context for future reference
- Avoids losing important intermediate insights

**Entry Format**:
```markdown
## Entry N: [Topic/Focus]
**Date**: [Date]
**Session**: [Brief description]

### [Findings/Decisions/Concerns]
[Content organized by type - findings, decisions, concerns, etc.]
```

### üéØ Current Session Focus

Moving forward from our Lucene/Tantivy analysis, ready to begin implementation of next phase. Key priorities:

1. **Generic KD-Tree extension** - support arbitrary dimensions
2. **BKD Configuration system** - match Lucene parameters
3. **Tree construction algorithm** - begin BKDWriter implementation

### üí≠ Implementation Questions for Next Work

1. **Dimensional Generics**: Use const generics `<const N: usize>` or runtime configuration?
2. **BKD Configuration**: Create config struct now or implement as we go?
3. **Storage Abstraction**: Start with in-memory, add disk storage later?
